# Robotics---Computational-Motion-Planning
## Goals of this PA: 
Implementing the planning systems that work on 2D grid like environments. For both sections the input map will be specified as a 2D logical array where the false or zero entries correspond to free cells and the true or non-zero entries correspond to obstacle cells. The goal of these planning routines is to construct a route between the specified start and destination cells. 
Two alforithms are to be implemented:
1. Dijkstra planner.
2. A* planner.
